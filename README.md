#Subreddit Notifier

This is a simple chrome extension I built because I wanted a simple way to keep track of any new freelance gigs coming in through /r/forhire.

#How To Use

Click "Download ZIP" in the right corner over there >>

Then go to `Settings > Extensions` in Chrome.

From there, enable `Developer mode` in the top right corner and drag and drop the `RedditNotifierChrome.crx` file into your browser. This will install the extension.

It'll add a little alien to your extension bar.

Once you setup a subreddit to watch and choose keywords, it'll search the subreddit for new posts with those keywords in the title or self text every 60 seconds.

Please note that you can use any of the following styles of subreddit.

`/r/webdev`

`/r/webdev/new`

`/r/webdev/rising`

`/r/webdev/gilded`

etc. etc. etc.

When new posts show up, a badge will appear showing how many new posts there are. Just click the extension icon to automatically be redirected to the subreddit.
